MinigolfVR - Asset-stripped version

Hey folks!

This is the asset stripped version of my first commercial Vive product - MinigolfVR. 

It was good fun to build, but having been abandoned for so long due to poor sales, I'm releasing the Unity project files for everyone to check out and hopefully help with their own game development.

Use it however you want. No attribution required.


This version has had all paid assets stripped from it, so if you want to recreate the full game, you'll need the following:
